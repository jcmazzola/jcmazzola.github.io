## About Me

My key areas of interest include statistical learning, econometrics, economic forecasting, and financial analysis. I’m especially drawn to industries where utilizing these technologies can improve outcomes, such as healthcare, technology, and finance. I chose this field because of the ever-changing nature of it, enjoy learning new things and continually expanding my skills to stay ahead in a dynamic field.

Currently during the semester, I work as a Peer Advisor and Tutor for UConn's Department of Economics. I truly enjoy being involved in the department and supporting my peers in their academic journeys. Further, in the Fall 2024 semester I interned with UConn's Field Hockey team as their Video Analyst and Student Manager, through the Sports Statistical Learning Internship. This experience was incredibly valuable in expanding my knowledge of sports analysis and the various methods used to evaluate performance and strategy. At the end of the semester I compiled a report from the season in which I was able to present. 

In Summer 2024 I worked at The Cigna Group as an Underwriting and Analytics Intern. I had the opportunity to work with the Pharmacy Underwriting team within Evernorth Health Services. Over the course of 10 weeks, I gained valuable experience in understanding the role of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) and how they navigate complex healthcare challenges. It was a valuable experience, and I had the opportunity to work on meaningful projects that provided insightful knowledge of the world of PBMs.

## Data Science Projects

#### [Field Hockey APC Analysis](https://github.com/jcmazzola/Field_Hockey_APC_analysis.git)

University of Connecticut– Sports Statistical Learning Internship

In the Fall 2024 semester, I had the opportunity to collaborate with UConn's Field Hockey team through the UConn Sports Statistical Learning Internship. This experience allowed me to investigate various factors influencing the success of attacking penalty corners. My aim was to provide actionable insights that could help enhance team strategies and improve performance outcomes.

This project is part of my broader effort to apply data science across a diverse range of fields, contributing valuable analysis to real-world challenges.

**Topics:** Sports analysis, scoring rate, Extreme Gradiant Boosting, feature importance, opponent analysis, classification, Plotnine, python.

#### [Data Visualization with Plotnine](https://github.com/jcmazzola/Visualization_with_Plotnine.git)

This class note contribution focuses on Plotnine, a Python library for creating visually appealing and effective visualizations. It includes examples and explanations of the various ways to customize visualizations, making them both user-friendly and informative. These resources are designed to help students develop skills they can apply in their careers, whether in corporate settings or academia.

These notes were presented to the Dr. Jun Yan's Fall 2024 Introduction to Data Science class.

**Topics:** Plotnine, python, lesson contribution, grammar of graphics, visualization, readability, facet plots, scatterplot, bar chart, histogram, line chart, regression line, customization.
   
#### [NASDAQ Composite Index Prediction](https://github.com/jcmazzola/NASDAQ_Prediction.git)

This project applies statistical learning techniques to predict the NASDAQ Composite Index, combining my interests in Economics and Data Science. Using historical stock data from January 4, 2010, to October 25, 2024, the analysis identifies key predictors of stock price movements, examines the impact of seasonality, and evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models for time-series forecasting.

**Topics:** Moving Average, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Python, Plotnine, feature importance analysis, time-series forecasting, feature engineering, financial analysis

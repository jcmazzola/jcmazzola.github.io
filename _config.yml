description: I am currently a senior at the University of Connecticut pursuing a double major in Economics and Statistical Data Science with a domain in Financial Analysis. I graduate May 2025 and live in the New York City Metropolitan Area. My key areas of interest include statistical learning, econometrics, economic forecasting, and financial analysis.                                    Iâ€™m especially drawn to industries where utilizing these technologies can improve outcomes, such as healthcare, technology, and finance. One of the main reasons I chose this field is the ever-changing nature of it. I enjoy learning new things and continually expanding my skills to stay ahead in a dynamic field.

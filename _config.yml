description: I am currently a senior at the University of Connecticut pursuing a double major in Economics and Statistical Data Science with a domain in Financial Analysis. I graduate May 2025 and live in the New York City Metropolitan Area. 

My key areas of interest include statistical learning, econometrics, economic forecasting, and financial analysis. Iâ€™m especially drawn to industries where utilizing these technologies can improve outcomes, such as healthcare, technology, and finance. One of the main reasons I chose this field is the ever-changing nature of it. I enjoy learning new things and continually expanding my skills to stay ahead in a dynamic field.

In my final semester this Spring, I will be working on my Capstone Project, which will integrate both of my areas of interest into a meaningful and impactful initiative. I am always eager to connect with professionals and peers in and outside of the industry, so please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:juliacmazzola@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliacmazzola/)!
